# CrowdSourcing_with_NLP
This is a Django project which incoperates NLP answer questions and crowd source information about tourism, accomodation and food.

This was part of my MSc Dissertation where I was investigating the use of natural language processing to crowdsource information that could be used to improver the campus life of new students atr universities in the United kingdom. 

The web app which is developed with the django framework asks questions to participants and and then using the information provided, develop a scheme from which answers could be derived for anyone who need information about campus life in UK universities. 

The NLTK library was used as the bases for NLP.  It also uses other APIs like DBpedia and Danelion to validate the knowledgebase built from the crowdsourced infomration. 

This web app, can be enhanced by using webscraping tools like beautiful soup to further crowdsource more useful information form the web or social media platforms.
